# Feedback on Final

I think your final project demonstrated your Python skills, but stayed very shallow in the questions and analysis you did. You merged in data that included the operator, location, route, type of craft, etc - there is a lot of rich data there, but you stuck with just looking at year, passenger count, and fatalities.  I feel like there are so many interesting questions. (-2 from Problem Applicability)

The required use of functions was intended for you to demonstrate reusability, testability, and encapsualaiton of logic.  Some of your functions didn't serve that purpose and none of your functions included tests. (-5 from Modularity / Style)

You did some interesting scatter plots at the end, but didn't say much about them.  I thought it was interesting how there was an outlier in your first chart suggesting that there were more fatalities than passengers aboard in one case.  Was that bad data or counting people killed on the ground?  Since your conclusions didn't fully come together to answer a particular question (-5 from Documentation and Professionalism)

Generally solid work, but I would have liked to see more.
